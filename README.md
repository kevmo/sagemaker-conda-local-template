# SageMaker Development Environment

This repository provides a template to kickstart your SageMaker development projects. It sets up a structured directory, creates an Anaconda environment, and installs necessary packages like SageMaker, MXNet, and PyTorch.

## Directory Structure

```│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/               # Raw data, unmodified
│   ├── processed/        # Cleaned data, ready for modeling
│   └── interim/          # Intermediate data, e.g., after preprocessing
├── notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test scripts
└── models/               # Trained models
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_sagemaker_project.git
cd my_sagemaker_project

* **Setup Everything**
  Simply run:
  `make setup`

   This command will:

   * Create a conda environment named `sagemaker_env`
   * Activate the conda environment
   * Install necessary packages
   * Set up the directory structure

### Individual Make Commands

* `make create-env`: Creates the conda environment.
* `make activate-env`: Activates the conda environment.
* `make install-packages`: Installs necessary Python packages.
* `make setup-dir`: Sets up the project directory structure.
* `make clean`: Removes the conda environment.

## Extending the Project

After forking the project, you may want to:

1. **Add custom Python packages** : Modify the `install-packages` command in the `Makefile` to add any additional packages you need.
2. **Incorporate other AWS tools** : Integrate with tools like [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html), or the [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
3. **Expand on Directory Structure** : Depending on your project's complexity, you might want to further segment directories or introduce new ones.
4. **Integrate CI/CD** : Implement continuous integration and deployment using platforms like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
